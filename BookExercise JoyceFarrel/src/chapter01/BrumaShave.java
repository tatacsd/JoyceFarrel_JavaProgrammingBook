				 * 12. From 1925 through 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to
		highways all across the United States. There were always four or five signs in
		a row containing pieces of a rhyme, followed by a final sign that read “Burma
		Shave.” For example, one set of signs that has been preserved by the Smithsonian
		Institution reads as follows:
		Shaving brushes
		You'll soon see 'em
		On a shelf
		In some museum
		Burma Shave
		Find a classic Burma Shave rhyme on the Web. Write, compile, and test a class
		that produces a series of four dialog boxes so that each displays one line of a
		Burma Shave slogan in turn. Save the class as BurmaShave.java.
